If `position: fixed;` isn't keeping it fixed while scrolling, something else might be interfering. Let's troubleshoot and refine the approach.

---

### âœ… **Final Fix: Ensure Full Page Coverage**
Try this refined version:

```css
.arch-shape {
    width: 25vw; /* 1/4 of the page width */
    height: 100vh; /* Cover full viewport height */
    background-color: #66a3ff; /* Light blue */
    
    /* Stick to the left side */
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;

    /* Create the vertical arch */
    clip-path: ellipse(100% 100% at 0% 50%);

    /* Push to the very back */
    z-index: -1;
}
```

### ðŸ”¥ **Troubleshooting Tips**
If it's still not behaving correctly:
1. **Ensure No Parent Container is Clipping It**  
   - If the `.arch-shape` is inside another `div` with `overflow: hidden;`, it **won't extend beyond that container**.  
   - Place it **directly inside `<body>`** to ensure it covers the full page.

2. **Test Without `clip-path`**
   - Remove `clip-path` temporarily and set `background-color: red;` to see if it's properly covering the area.

3. **Check for Other `z-index` Elements**
   - If something else has a **higher `z-index`**, it might be overlapping the shape.

If the `.black-link` class isnâ€™t working as expected, check the following:  

### **1. Ensure the CSS is Applied Properly**
Make sure your CSS has a rule for `.black-link` like this:  
```css
.black-link {
    color: black; /* Ensures the text is black */
    text-decoration: none; /* Optional: removes underline */
}
```

If the color doesnâ€™t change, try adding `!important`:  
```css
.black-link {
    color: black !important;
}
```

### **2. Check for Conflicting Styles**
Other CSS rules might be overriding `.black-link`.  
Use **DevTools (F12 â†’ Inspect Element)** to check if another rule is affecting the linkâ€™s color.  

### **3. Verify Dark/Light Mode Handling**
If you're using a **dark mode** toggle, make sure `.black-link` isnâ€™t overridden by another rule. You might need:  
```css
body.light .black-link {
    color: black;
}

body.dark .black-link {
    color: white;
}
```

### **4. Ensure Your CSS File is Loaded**
If none of the above works, check:  
- Is your CSS file linked correctly in `<head>`?  
- Are there caching issues? Try a hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`).  

Try these steps and let me know if it still doesnâ€™t work!
